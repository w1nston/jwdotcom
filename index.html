            <h1>Continuous Delivery Pipeline - Take one</h1>
            <p>
              So this is my attempt at creating a continuous delivery pipeline.
              First it seems like a good idea to just deliver something to a
              server manually to get a feel for what needs to be done,
              and what steps can be automated.
            </p>
            <h2>The project structure</h2>
            <p>
              The focus is on the delivery pipeline, not on the content. In other words, no worries
              about what library to chose, how to configure webpack, or what color to use on the
              headlines. It is actually really difficult to let go of all that. But need to move
              forward!
            </p>
            <p>
              So, the structure consists of an index.html file that actually is the page, as well as
              a public directory containing any assets. The assets for the time being are one simple
              stylesheet and a svg image.
            </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
                |-rootDirectory
                | |-public
                | | |-assets
                | | | |-images
                | | | | |-logo.svg
                | | | |-styles
                | | | | |-style.css
                | |-index.html
              </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              The project is checked in at
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://github.com/w1nston/jwdotcom"
              >Github</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>The server structure</h2>
            <p>
              The server is running on a virtual private server (VPS), setup with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
              Following the guides on
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server"
              >Linode</a>, and in the home
              directory the project is cloned from Github. I then copied the index.html and the
              public directory to
              <code class="bash">
                /srv/www/example.com/(date)/
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              To serve the content I use
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://nginx.org/en/"
              >nginx</a>, and am pointing the root location to
              <code class="bash">
                /srv/www/example.com/latest
              </code>, where the <i>latest</i>-directory is simply a symbolic link pointing to
              another
              sibling directory named with a date. This makes it easy to point to a new release
              once available. E.g:
            <ul>
              <li><code>20160810/</code></li>
              <li><code>20160917/</code></li>
              <li><code>latest -> 20160917/</code></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
              I have a first version of a pipeline, maybe not much of a continuous delivery
              pipeline just yet, but lets see what we got.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this approach the pipeline looks like follows. I do a change in the source,
              push it to the origin repository. Manually login to the VPS, pull the
              new changes, copy them to a new directory, and name it with the current date. Oh,
              wait! What about two or more releases during one day?
            </p>
            <p>
              I clearly need to figure out a better way to deal with release versions, duly noted.
              But lets move on...
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the files are copied over to the versioned release directory and we feel lucky.
              A new symlink needs to be created, and it should of course point to the most recent
              release version.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, a lot of manual steps, but that's what's to be expected since the goal was to
              just get anything working. It is easier to improve something than it is to create
              something perfect from the beginning.
            </p>
            <h2>Improvement points</h2>
            <p>
              So, what can be improved? Initially I see two points to improve: release versioning,
              and number of manual steps.
            </p>
            <h3>Release versioning</h3>
            <p>
              <code>// TODO</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Number of manual steps</h3>
            <p>
              From <code>$ git push</code> there shouldn't be too many steps before a new release
              can be tested, and finally deployed. With this pipeline there are at least five steps
              before a new release sees the light of day.
            </p>
            <p>
              One step to login to the VPS, one step to pull the updates from Github, one step to
              copy the files to a new versioned release directory, one step to redirect the
              <i>latest</i>-symlink, and lastly, one step to reload the nginx-server.
            </p>
